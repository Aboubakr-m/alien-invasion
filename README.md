## game description

In Alien Invasion, the player controls a ship that appears at the bottom center of the screen. \
The player can move the ship right, left, up, and down using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the spacebar. \
When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the skyand moves across and down the screen. \
The player shoots and destroys the aliens. If the player shoots all the aliens, a new fleet appears that moves faster than the previous fleet.
If any alien hits the playerâ€™s ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends.
